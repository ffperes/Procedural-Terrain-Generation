\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I am hugely grateful to the people who helped me.
Thank you darling mother for giving birth to me. Without you and daddy this
project would not have been possible.

I would also like to thank Professor Heinrich Wormold for his expert
tuition in Java and Welsh.

I would like to thank my Cat, Dennis, for help with Java programming and to last
but not least to the Merlin the Wizard for  leading  me to a golden age

\section{The Hello World Problem}


In this project I am attempting to solve the well-know hello world problem. In
this problem we tried to make the computer display  {\bf hello World} on the
screen using the Object oriented programming language, Java. Although there have
been many solutions in other languages including
Mandarin~\cite{KuhnScottAndreev2008}, we believe this is the first solution to
the problem in Welsh.

\section{Why my problem is interesting}
This problem is very interesting as there have been many proposed solutions
all of which have their drawbacks. These are discussed further in
In Chapter~\ref{chap:background} on page \pageref{chap:background}. 

\section{The layout of my report}
You probably write this section last (but before the abstract).

In Chapter~\ref{chap:background} on page \pageref{chap:background} 
I discuss the background to my Project.

In Chapter~\ref{chap:seleval}, Page \pageref{chap:background} I evaluate my
project. In Section~\ref{sec:outcomes} I discuss how well I met the original
goals of my project.

\section{The Problem being solved}
\label{sec:probsolv}

The aim of the project is to produce a Welsh version of the hello world
program.   In the process we hope to forge links between digital technologies
and artistic practice. We will develop original theories, new departures in the
technological arts and pioneering, and commercially viable, to produce a
sustainable software product.   In order to complete the project I will
undertake research into work from the culture industries, film production,
design consultancies, museums and galleries, interactive media content
providers, software development houses, and hardware design laboratories - to
explore and extend the use of today's digital technology and to define and
implement the art and design technologies of tomorrow.

\subsection{How other People Have Solved it}
\label{sub:other}

\subsubsection{Hello World in C}
In Section~\ref{sub:other} I talk about how other people have so


The first known instance of the usage of the words "hello" and "world" together
in computer literature occurred earlier, in Kernighan's 1972 Tutorial
Introduction to the Language~\cite{KuhnScottAndreev2008}, with the following
code:

\begin{verbatim}
main( ) {
  extrn a, b, c;
  putchar(a); putchar(b); putchar(c); putchar('!*n');
}
a 'hell';
b 'o, w';
c 'orld';
\end{verbatim}



Apart from not being in Welsh, its obtuse structure clearly fails to forge links
between digital technologies and artistic practice.

(Part of the learning objectives of level 3 (which is where you are now) is the
exercise of critical judgement; it is up to you to judge critically what
appropriate titles and wordings for your report are, based on academic reports
you have read during your course of study.)


\subsubsection{Hello World in Erlang}
In 1805 Gottfried Llantwit-Major \cite{BookB} produced the first Erlang
version:

\begin{verbatim}
-module(hello).

-export([hello/0]).

hello() ->
   io:format("Sut dach chi?", []).
\end{verbatim}

Although this is very good attempt, as the reader will observe, it produces
Welsh output. Unfortunately however, it does not translate correctly to 
Hello World.

\subsubsection{A more Goldsmithian Example}
\begin{verbatim}
#include <stdio.h>
    main(){int i,n[]={(((1<<1)<<(1<<1)<<(1<<
    1)<<(1<<(1>>1)))+((1<<1)<<(1<<1))), (((1
    <<1)<<(1<<1)<<(1<<1)<<(1<<1))-((1<<1)<<(
    1<<1)<<(1<<1))+((1<<1)<<(1<<(1>>1)))+ (1
    <<(1>>1))),(((1<<1)<<(1<<1)<<(1<<1)<< (1
    <<1))-((1<<1)<<(1<<1)<<(1<<(1>>1)))- ((1
    <<1)<<(1<<(1>>1)))),(((1<<1)<<(1<<1)<<(1
    <<1)<<(1<<1))-((1<<1)<<(1<<1)<<(1<<(1>>1
    )))-((1<<1)<<(1<<(1>>1)))),(((1<<1)<< (1
    <<1)<<(1<<1)<<(1<<1))-((1<<1)<<(1<<1)<<(
    1<<(1>>1)))-(1<<(1>>1))),(((1<<1)<<(1<<1
    )<<(1<<1))+((1<<1)<<(1<<1)<<(1<<(1>>1)))
    -((1<<1)<<(1<<(1>>1)))),((1<<1)<< (1<<1)
    <<(1<<1)),(((1<<1)<<(1<<1)<<(1<<1)<<(1<<
    1))-((1<<1)<<(1<<1))-(1<<(1>>1))),(((1<<
    1)<<(1<<1)<<(1<<1)<<(1<<1))-((1<<1)<< (1
    <<1)<<(1<<(1>>1)))-(1<<(1>>1))), (((1<<1
    )<<(1<<1)<<(1<<1)<<(1<<1))- ((1<<1)<< (1
    <<1)<<(1<<(1>>1)))+(1<<1)), (((1<<1)<< (
    1<<1)<<(1<<1)<< (1<<1))-((1<<1)<< (1<<1)
    <<(1<<(1>>1)))-((1<<1) <<(1<< (1>>1)))),
    (((1<<1)<< (1<<1)<<(1<<1)<< (1<<1))- ((1
    <<1)<<(1<<1)<<(1<<1))+((1<<1)<< (1<<(1>>
    1)))), (((1<<1)<<(1<<1) <<(1<<1))+(1<<(1
    >>1))),(((1<<1)<<(1<<1))+((1<<1)<< (1<<(
    1>>1))) + (1<< (1>>1)))}; for(i=(1>>1);i
    <(((1<<1) <<(1<<1))+((1 <<1)<< (1<<(1>>1
    ))) + (1<<1)); i++) printf("%c\n",n[i]); }
\end{verbatim}


This solution typically involves a group of participants standing or sitting
together in a circle, with a side-lying, empty bottle on the ground at their
epicentre. The bottle functions like the spinner for a standard board game, with
its opening serving as the pointer. Here we  explore alternative or additional
overlays that can be applied including bin-the-spottle, spin-the-bottle, hi-fi,
show you mine if you show me yours, seven minutes in heaven, hopes, fears and
dreams and sight for sore eyes.

\section{The Science and Technology needed to solve it}
\subsection{In various sections, describing the technological tools you'll use}

We conduct an exploration of analog and digital bodies, using a range of
technologies to remap the solid and obdurate real of bodies into the dispersions
and virtualities of the digital, and then back again into real physical spaces.
The "Hello World" of the title means at least three things.

Firstly, the pasting of viewpoints together, the suturing of the subject into
the avatar. Secondly, paste as glue, as half-liquid and half solid, as a
materiality of renewable and infinite pliability. This is the chora of the
avatar, the body matrix that is less a framework than a smearing of paste. And
thirdly, paste as pasty and dis/comfortable substance, paste as slimy and
dripping. While this abjection is already implicit in paste as glue, the
pastiness of paste involves the projection and dreaming through of the avatar,
the inhabitation of avatar bodies and the emptying of real bodies into the
avatar.

"Hello World" comes out in avatar motions and behaviours. Firstly, these are
formed by symbolic orders, presenting surfaces to read in terms of sexuality,
power, emotion, and other projections. At the same time, the pasty avatar body
tends towards collapse and abjection. Work on the avatar becomes a choreography
of exposure and rupture, modelling and presenting inconceivable and untenable
data, within which tensions and relationships are immediate and intimate. One
might imagine, then, this inconceivable data as a form of organism itself: as
part of a natural world or a world already given; out of this we might think
through new ideas of landscape, wilderness, hard ecology, the earth itself.

The project will theorise and demonstrate these topics. The first part
discusses theoretical frameworks. We will introduce the topic of
dismemberment and telepresence in terms of the presence or appearance of
abjection in Second Life avatars. He will connect this to the epistemology of
emptiness vis-a-vis sheave theory and Buddhist philosophy, and then to the
problems of motion and behaviour of avatars. Sandy Baldwin will discuss the
topography of limits in Second Life, both body limits and spatial limits, an
connect this to issues of the hunt and animal display.

We will also discuss the dynamics of performance and audience in Second Life.
The second part of the project will show off Sondheim and Baldwin's approach to
re-mapping live bodies into Second Life performances, including: video and other
examples of motion capture and scanning; intermediate processing of files (e.g.
editing .bvh data or working with Blender); and then the resulting works,
including documents of Second Life performances and re-mappings back into "first
life" spaces with dancers and other live performers. The final part of the
project will include avatar performance by Sondheim, Baldwin, and other
participants in Second Life.

\section{Useful Information}
\subsection{Help with \LaTeX}
You can get help with \LaTeX and BibTex from 
\htmladdnormallink{http://www.math.harvard.edu/texman/}{http://www.math.harvard.edu/texman/}

\cite{KuhnScottAndreev2008}, and from {\tt http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX}.





\begin{quote} \citet{ArticleA} argue that nothing is true. You use this if you
need to make the authors part of your sentence. Look at the {\tt .tex} file to
see how this is done. 
\end{quote}

The second is as follows:
\begin{quote}

It has been argued that nothing is true \citep{ArticleA}. You use this if you
don't mention the authors in your sentence. Look at the {\tt .tex} file to see
how this is done.

\end{quote}
When you do this, you must have a definition for each item in your {\tt DoCReport.bib} file. There is an example to help you, for journal articles \citep{ArticleA}, books \citep{BookB}, chapters in collection books \citep{CollectedC}, and miscellaneous things like web sites \citep{MiscD}. You can make up the keys for these things (that is, {\tt ArticleA}, {\it etc.}); you just need to make sure that each is unique. It doesn't matter what order to place the entries in the {\tt .bib} file.

If you compare the entries in the {\tt .bib} file, you'll see that each is
rendered differently into a bibliography entry at the back of the formatted
report. \LaTeX and BibTeX handle this correctly on your behalf -- but make sure you read error messages and act on them, because the software can't correct any errors you make!

\subsection{An important thing to note!!}

LaTeX deals carefully with all the forward and backward referencing in your document ({\it e.g.,} tables of contents, {\it etc.}). This means that you sometimes need to run it as many as three times before all the inter-dependencies are sorted out. Make sure you read the output of the program, which will tell you when you need to run it again.
